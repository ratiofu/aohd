# Amazon Order History Downloader – AOHD

## Description

Exporting and downloading order history from Amazon is a pain.

This project is a Chrome Extension hack that will parse both the order list
and each printable order invoice to collect order details that can then be
exported to TSV (tab delimited).

> :warning: This is an absolute hack and a W.I.P. :warning:
> 
> This isn't meant for anyone else, I just wanted to store the code somewhere.
